# Unit of Work

This code is a result of pair codding session between [Norbert Orzechowicz](https://github.com/norzechowicz) & [Dawid Sajdak](https://github.com/dawidsajdak).
Its not production ready, actually is not even working yet so don't think about using it ;)

Our goal was to create simple but generic UnitOfWork that would allow developers to define how to behave when
object is created, removed or deleted.
